# TransactWrite Fix - AttributeError Resolution

## Problem

When attempting to create a collection with PynamoDB, the following error occurred:

```
AttributeError: 'TableConnection' object has no attribute 'transact_write_items'
```

## Root Cause

The error was caused by incorrect usage of PynamoDB's `TransactWrite` context manager:

```python
# ❌ INCORRECT - Causes AttributeError
with TransactWrite(connection=CollectionModel._get_connection()) as transaction:
    transaction.save(model)
```

The issue: `Model._get_connection()` returns a `TableConnection` object, which is an internal class that wraps a specific table and **does not implement** the `transact_write_items` method required by DynamoDB transactions.

## Solution

Use `TransactWrite()` **without any connection parameter**. PynamoDB automatically manages the connection to DynamoDB:

```python
# ✅ CORRECT - PynamoDB handles the connection
with TransactWrite() as transaction:
    transaction.save(collection)
    transaction.save(user_relationship)
    transaction.update(parent, actions=[...])
    transaction.delete(share)
```

## Files Fixed

### 1. `handlers/collections_post.py` (Line 106)

**Before:**

```python
with TransactWrite(connection=CollectionModel._get_connection()) as transaction:
```

**After:**

```python
with TransactWrite() as transaction:
```

### 2. `handlers/collections_ID_share_post.py` (Line 79)

**Before:**

```python
with TransactWrite(connection=ShareModel._get_connection()) as transaction:
```

**After:**

```python
with TransactWrite() as transaction:
```

### 3. `handlers/collections_ID_share_ID_delete.py`

**Complete Refactor:**

- Changed from boto3's `dynamodb.meta.client.transact_write_items()`
- To PynamoDB's `TransactWrite()` with proper model usage
- Added proper error handling with `DoesNotExist` exception
- Updated function signature from `register_route(app, dynamodb, table_name)` to `register_route(app)`

**Before:**

```python
dynamodb.meta.client.transact_write_items(
    TransactItems=[
        {
            "Delete": {
                "TableName": table_name,
                "Key": {
                    "PK": f"{COLLECTION_PK_PREFIX}{collection_id}",
                    "SK": f"{PERM_SK_PREFIX}{user_id}",
                },
            }
        },
        # ... more items
    ]
)
```

**After:**

```python
try:
    share = ShareModel.get(share_pk, share_sk)
    user_rel = UserRelationshipModel.get(user_pk, user_sk)
except DoesNotExist:
    return error_response(...)

with TransactWrite() as transaction:
    transaction.delete(share)
    transaction.delete(user_rel)
```

## Why This Works

1. **PynamoDB Connection Management**: When you call `TransactWrite()` without parameters, PynamoDB uses its internal connection pool that properly implements all DynamoDB operations including `transact_write_items`.

2. **TableConnection vs Connection**:
   - `TableConnection`: Internal class for single-table operations (query, scan, get, etc.)
   - `Connection`: Full DynamoDB client with all operations including transactions
   - `TransactWrite()` needs the latter, not the former

3. **Automatic Region/Endpoint**: PynamoDB uses the region and endpoint configured in the Model's Meta class (set from environment variables in `index.py`).

## Verification Steps

After deploying, test these critical transaction operations:

1. **Create child collection**: `POST /collections` with `parentId`
   - Creates 3 items atomically (collection, user relationship, child reference)
   - Updates parent's `childCollectionCount`

2. **Share collection**: `POST /collections/{id}/share`
   - Creates 2 items atomically (permission, user relationship)

3. **Remove share**: `DELETE /collections/{id}/share/{userId}`
   - Deletes 2 items atomically (permission, user relationship)

## Additional Notes

- **PynamoDB Version**: Requires PynamoDB >= 4.3.3 for transaction support
- **Lambda Layer**: Ensure `pynamodb>=6.0.0` is in Lambda layer requirements
- **No Breaking Changes**: This fix only changes internal implementation; API contracts remain the same
- **Documentation Updated**: `PYNAMODB_MIGRATION_COMPLETE.md` now reflects correct usage
