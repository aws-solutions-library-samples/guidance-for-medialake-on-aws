# Collections Lambda Migration Summary

## ✅ Completed Tasks

The Collections API has been successfully refactored from multiple individual Lambda functions into a single consolidated Lambda function with internal routing using AWS Lambda Powertools.

### What Was Done

1. **Created New Lambda Structure** ✅
   - Created `/lambdas/api/collections_api/` directory
   - Organized code into modular route files
   - Set up proper dependency management

2. **Main Handler Implementation** ✅
   - Created `index.py` with Lambda Powertools `APIGatewayRestResolver`
   - Configured CORS and routing
   - Set up proper logging, tracing, and metrics

3. **Route Modules Created** ✅
   - `collection_types_routes.py` - Collection types management
   - `collections_routes.py` - List and create collections
   - `collection_detail_routes.py` - Individual collection CRUD operations
   - `items_routes.py` - Collection items management
   - `rules_routes.py` - Collection rules management
   - `shares_routes.py` - Collection sharing functionality
   - `assets_routes.py` - Collection assets retrieval (OpenSearch integration)

4. **Infrastructure Updated** ✅
   - Updated `medialake_constructs/api_gateway/api_gateway_collections.py`
   - Implemented API Gateway proxy integration
   - Configured single Lambda deployment
   - Set up proper IAM permissions for DynamoDB and OpenSearch

5. **Shared Utilities** ✅
   - Leveraged existing `collections_utils.py` from common libraries
   - Used existing `user_auth.py` for authentication
   - All shared logic remains in Lambda layer

6. **Documentation Created** ✅
   - `README.md` - Comprehensive documentation
   - `CLEANUP_GUIDE.md` - Safe cleanup instructions
   - `MIGRATION_SUMMARY.md` - This file

## Architecture Changes

### Before

```
API Gateway
├── GET /collection-types → Lambda 1
├── POST /collection-types → Lambda 2
├── GET /collections → Lambda 3
├── POST /collections → Lambda 4
├── GET /collections/{id} → Lambda 5
├── ... (20+ individual lambdas)
```

### After

```
API Gateway
├── /collection-types/* → Single Collections Lambda (with routing)
└── /collections/* → Single Collections Lambda (with routing)
    ├── Internal Router (Lambda Powertools)
    ├── ├── collection_types_routes
    ├── ├── collections_routes
    ├── ├── collection_detail_routes
    ├── ├── items_routes
    ├── ├── rules_routes
    ├── ├── shares_routes
    └── └── assets_routes
```

## Benefits

1. **Reduced Cold Starts**: Single Lambda means faster response times for subsequent requests
2. **Simplified Deployment**: One Lambda to deploy instead of 20+
3. **Better Code Organization**: Modular route files maintain separation of concerns
4. **Easier Maintenance**: Shared utilities and consistent patterns
5. **Cost Optimization**: Potential cost savings from reduced Lambda invocations
6. **Simplified Monitoring**: Single Lambda to monitor and debug

```

## Next Steps

### 1. Deploy the Changes

```bash
# From project root
cdk deploy <your-stack-name>
```

### 2. Test Thoroughly

Use the testing checklist in `CLEANUP_GUIDE.md` to verify all endpoints work correctly.

Test commands:

```bash
# List collections
curl -X GET https://your-api/collections \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <token>'

# Create collection
curl -X POST https://your-api/collections \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"name": "Test", "description": "Test collection"}'

# Get collection
curl -X GET https://your-api/collections/{id} \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <token>'
```

### 3. Monitor

- Check CloudWatch logs: `/aws/lambda/collections_api`
- Monitor metrics in CloudWatch namespace: `medialake`
- Review X-Ray traces for performance

### 4. Cleanup (After Testing)

Once you've verified everything works:

1. Review `CLEANUP_GUIDE.md`
2. Follow the cleanup checklist
3. Remove old lambda directories

**Important**: Only cleanup after thorough testing!

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise:

```bash
# Restore old files
git checkout HEAD -- lambdas/api/collections/
git checkout HEAD -- medialake_constructs/api_gateway/api_gateway_collections.py

# Redeploy
cdk deploy <your-stack-name>
```

## API Endpoints

All endpoints remain the same:

**Collection Types**

- `GET /collection-types` - List collection types
- `POST /collection-types` - Create collection type

**Collections**

- `GET /collections` - List collections
- `POST /collections` - Create collection
- `GET /collections/shared-with-me` - Shared collections
- `GET /collections/{id}` - Get collection
- `PATCH /collections/{id}` - Update collection
- `DELETE /collections/{id}` - Delete collection

**Items**

- `GET /collections/{id}/items` - List items
- `POST /collections/{id}/items` - Add item
- `POST /collections/{id}/items/batch` - Batch add
- `POST /collections/{id}/items/batch-remove` - Batch remove

## Technical Details

### Lambda Configuration

- **Runtime**: Python 3.x
- **Handler**: `index.lambda_handler`
- **Layers**: Common libraries (collections_utils, user_auth)
- **Environment Variables**:
  - `COLLECTIONS_TABLE_NAME`
  - `COLLECTIONS_TABLE_ARN`
  - `X_ORIGIN_VERIFY_SECRET_ARN`
  - `OPENSEARCH_ENDPOINT`
  - `OPENSEARCH_INDEX`

### Dependencies

- aws-lambda-powertools[tracer,validation]>=2.31.0
- boto3>=1.28.0
- botocore>=1.31.0
- opensearch-py>=2.0.0
- pydantic>=2.0.0

### Permissions

- DynamoDB: Read/Write access to Collections table
- OpenSearch: ESHttpGet, ESHttpPost, ESHttpPut
- Secrets Manager: Read access to X-Origin secret

## Monitoring

**CloudWatch Metrics** (namespace: `medialake`):

- SuccessfulCollectionRetrievals
- FailedCollectionRetrievals
- SuccessfulCollectionCreations
- FailedCollectionCreations
- ValidationErrors
- UnexpectedErrors
- (And many more service-specific metrics)

**CloudWatch Logs**:

- Structured JSON logging
- Correlation IDs for request tracking
- Detailed error information

**X-Ray Tracing**:

- End-to-end request tracing
- Performance monitoring
- Dependency visualization

## Known Considerations

1. **Cold Start**: First request after idle period may be slower
   - Consider provisioned concurrency for high-traffic scenarios

2. **Lambda Timeout**: Default timeout may need adjustment for complex operations
   - Monitor execution times in CloudWatch

3. **Memory**: Adjust Lambda memory if needed based on usage patterns

4. **Concurrent Execution**: Monitor for throttling under high load

## Support and Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Route not found (404)**

- Verify API Gateway proxy integration is configured
- Check Lambda routing in `index.py`
- Review CloudWatch logs for routing errors

**Permission denied errors**

- Verify Lambda execution role has correct permissions
- Check environment variables are set properly

**Timeout errors**

- Increase Lambda timeout in CDK configuration
- Optimize DynamoDB queries
- Check for network issues with OpenSearch

### Getting Help

1. Check CloudWatch logs first
2. Review X-Ray traces for performance issues
3. Refer to README.md for detailed documentation
4. Check AWS Lambda Powertools docs: https://docs.powertools.aws.dev/

## Success Criteria

✅ The migration is successful when:

1. All API endpoints return expected responses
2. No errors in CloudWatch logs
3. Response times are acceptable
4. Authentication works correctly
5. DynamoDB operations are efficient
6. CloudWatch metrics are being recorded
7. Frontend application works without issues

## Conclusion

The Collections API has been successfully consolidated into a single Lambda function with efficient routing using AWS Lambda Powertools. The code is now more maintainable, performant, and follows AWS best practices.

**Next action**: Deploy and test the new lambda thoroughly before cleaning up old directories.
